From them, erythrocytes membrane vesicles can be generated, employable as nano drug delivery system with prolonged blood residence and high biocompatibility. Human erythrocyte ghosts were extruded in the presence of siRNA, and the objects were termed EMVs (erythrocyte membrane vesicles). An ultracentrifugation-based method was applied to select only the densest EMVs, ie, those containing siRNA. We evaluated their activity in vitro in B16F10 cells expressing fluorescent tdTomato and in vivo in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice after a single injection. The EMVs had a negative zeta potential, a particle size of 170 nm and excellent colloidal stability after one month of storage. With 0.3 nM siRNA, more than 75% gene knockdown was achieved in vitro, and 80% was achieved in vivo, at 2 days PI at 2.5 mg/kg. EMVs mostly accumulate around blood vessels in the lungs, brain and tumor. tdTomato fluorescence steadily decreased in tumor areas with higher EMVs concentration, which indicates efficient gene knockdown. Approximately 2% of the initial dose of EMVs was still present in the plasma after 2 days. The entire production process of the purified siRNA-EMVs took approximately 4\u00a0hours.

The weight loss process is slow and complex, and involves lifestyle changes with an emphasis on nutritional therapy, physical activity practice, psychological interventions, and pharmacological or surgical treatment. Because the management of obesity is a long-term process, it is essential that the nutritional treatment contributes to the maintenance of the individual\u2019s global health. The main diet-related causes associated with excess weight are the high consumption of ultraprocessed foods, which are high in fats, sugars, and have high energy density; increased portion sizes; and low intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains. In addition, some situations negatively interfere with the weight loss process, such as fad diets that involve the belief in superfoods, the use of teas and phytotherapics, or even the avoidance of certain food groups, as has currently been the case for foods that are sources of carbohydrates. Individuals with obesity are often exposed to fad diets and, on a recurring basis, adhere to proposals with promises of quick solutions, which are not supported by the scientific literature. The adoption of a dietary pattern combining foods such as grains, lean meats, low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables, associated with an energy deficit, is the nutritional treatment recommended by the main international guidelines. Moreover, an emphasis on behavioral aspects including motivational interviewing and the encouragement for the individual to develop skills will contribute to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Therefore, this Position Statement was prepared based on the analysis of the main randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses that tested different nutrition interventions for weight loss. Topics in the frontier of knowledge such as gut microbiota, inflammation, and nutritional genomics, as well as the processes involved in weight regain, were included in this document.

However, only a minority of patients have significant responses to these treatments alone. Combining CD47 blockades with other treatment modalities are in clinical studies, with early results suggesting a synergistic therapeutic effect.

This analysis gave rise to the integrated, multilevel formulation described herein, which transforms thinking about stress biology and provides a biologically based, evolutionary account for how and why experiences of social safety and social threat are strongly related to health, well-being, aging, and longevity. In doing so, the theory advances a testable framework for investigating the biopsychosocial roots of health disparities as well as how health-relevant biopsychosocial processes crystalize over time and how perceptions of the social environment interact with childhood microbial environment, birth cohort, culture, air pollution, genetics, sleep, diet, personality, and self-harm to affect health.

Current practices related to transport of sheep during the different stages (preparation, loading and unloading, transit and journey breaks) are described. Overall, 11 welfare consequences were identified as being highly relevant for the welfare of sheep during transport based on severity, duration and frequency of occurrence: group stress, handling stress, heat stress, injuries, motion stress, predation stress, prolonged hunger, prolonged thirst, restriction of movement, resting problems and sensory overstimulation. These welfare consequences and their animal\u2010based measures are described. A wide variety of hazards, mainly relating to inappropriate or aggressive handling of animals, structural deficiencies of vehicles and facilities, unfavourable microclimatic and environmental conditions and poor husbandry practices, leading to these welfare consequences were identified. The Opinion contains general and specific conclusions in relation to the different stages of transport. Recommendations to prevent hazards and to correct or mitigate welfare consequences have been developed. Recommendations were also developed to define quantitative thresholds for microclimatic conditions within the means of transport and spatial thresholds (minimum space allowance). The development of welfare consequences over time were assessed in relation to maximum journey time.

The TME impedes tumor trafficking and penetration of T lymphocytes and installs an immunosuppressive milieu by producing suppressive soluble factors and by overexpressing negative immune checkpoints. In order to overcome these hurdles, new CAR-T cells engineering strategies were designed, to potentiate tumor recognition and infiltration and anti-cancer activity in the hostile TME.

Moreover, clear, truthful, and direct information about food, based on science, is essential to build trust among consumers and advance food safety. Traditionally, the role of the slaughterhouse is guaranteeing the safety of meat from the perspective of animal pathology and disease. However, it can be used for monitoring other aspects that influence not only the animal health (One Health), but also the food safety and public health. The present review discusses the role of the slaughterhouse to guarantee the food safety and monitor aspects, such as animal welfare, antimicrobial resistance, or prevalence of foodborne and zoonotic diseases. From the point of public health, the objective of the slaughterhouse is to guarantee the safety of meat in which meat inspection represent an essential tool to control animal diseases and guarantee the public health. The slaughterhouse can be used as surveillance center for livestock diseases. However, other aspects related with animal and human health, such as epidemiology and disease control in primary production, control of animal welfare on the farm, surveillance of zoonotic agents responsible for food poisoning, as well as surveillance and control of antimicrobial resistance, can be monitored. These controls should not be seen as a last defensive barrier but rather as a complement to the controls carried out on the farm. Regarding the control of diseases in livestock, scientific research is scarce and outdated, not taking advantage of the potential for disease control. Animal welfare in primary production and during transport can be monitored throughout ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection at the slaughterhouse, providing valuable individual data on animal welfare. Surveillance and research regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at slaughterhouses is scarce, mainly in cattle, sheep, and goats. However, most of the zoonotic pathogens are sensitive to the antibiotics studied. Moreover, the prevalence at the slaughterhouse of zoonotic and foodborne agents seems to be low, but a lack of harmonization in terms of control and communication may lead to underestimate its real prevalence.", "final_rank": 20}

It consists of diverse cell types, extracellular matrix components, and signaling molecules that interact to promote tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. Elucidating the intricate interactions between cancer cells and the TME is crucial in understanding cancer progression and therapeutic challenges. A critical process induced by TME signaling is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), wherein epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal traits, which enhance their motility and invasiveness and promote metastasis and cancer progression. By targeting various components of the TME, novel investigational strategies aim to disrupt the TME\u2019s contribution to the EMT, thereby improving treatment efficacy, addressing therapeutic resistance, and offering a nuanced approach to cancer therapy. This review scrutinizes the key players in the TME and the TME's contribution to the EMT, emphasizing avenues to therapeutically disrupt the interactions between the various TME components.

BsAb armed T cells offer a safe alternative. We generated ex vivo armed T cells (EATs) using IgG-[L]-scFv-platformed BsAb, where the anti-CD3 (huOKT3) scFv was attached to the light chain of a tumor-binding IgG. BsAb density on EAT, in vitro cytotoxicity, cytokine release, in vivo trafficking into tumors, and their antitumor activities were evaluated in multiple cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. The efficacy of EATs after cryopreservation was studied, and gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cells were investigated as unrelated alternative effector T cells. The antitumor potency of BsAb armed T cells was substantially improved using the IgG-[L]-scFv BsAb platform. When compared with separate BsAb and T cell injection, EATs released less TNF-\u03b1, and infiltrated tumors faster, while achieving robust antitumor responses. The in vivo potency of EAT therapy depended on BsAb dose for arming, EAT cell number per injection, total number of EAT doses, and treatment schedule intensity. The antitumor efficacy of EATs was preserved following cryopreservation, and EATs using \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were safe and as effective as \u03b1\u03b2 T cell-EATs.

Kentucky is notable for heavy rural HIV burden and increasing rates of new HIV diagnoses attributable to injection drug use. Despite high need and the strong evidence for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) as a gold-standard biomedical HIV prevention tool, scale up has been limited among PWID in Kentucky and elsewhere. This paper explores individual, environmental, and structural barriers and facilitators of PrEP care from the perspective of PWID in rural Kentucky. Data are drawn from an ongoing NIH-funded study designed to adapt and integrate a PrEP initiation intervention for high-risk PWID at point of care in two rural syringe service programs (SSPs) in southeastern Kentucky. As part of this initiative, a qualitative study guided by PRISM (Practical, Robust, Implementation, and Sustainability Model) was undertaken to gather SSP client perspectives on intervention needs related to PrEP, competing needs related to substance use disorder, as well as tangible supports for and barriers to PrEP uptake. Recruitment and interviews were conducted during September-November 2021 with 26 SSP clients, 13 from each of the two SSP sites. A semi-structured guide explored injection behaviors, SSP use, knowledge of PrEP, perceived barriers to PrEP, as well as aspects of the risk environment (e.g., housing instability, community stigma) that may impact PrEP uptake. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and verified by project staff. A detailed coding scheme was developed and applied by independent coders using NVivo. Coded transcripts were synthesized to identify salient themes in the data using the principles of thematic analysis All study procedures were approved by the University IRB. Participants were 96% white, 42% female, with a median age of 41 years (range 21\u201362); all reported injection use within the past month. Overall, we found low PrEP awareness among this sample, yet interest in PrEP was high, with several indicating PrEP is urgently needed. Clients reported overwhelmingly positive experiences at the SSPs, considering them trusted and safe locations to receive health services, and were enthusiastic about the integration of co-located PrEP services. Lack of basic HIV and PrEP knowledge and health literacy were in evidence, which contributed to common misperceptions about personal risk for HIV. Situational risks related to substance use disorder, particularly in the context of withdrawal symptoms and craving, often lead to heightened HIV injection and sexual risk behaviors. Stigma related to substance use and HIV arose as a concern for PrEP uptake, with several participants reflecting that privacy issues would impact their preferences for education, prescribing and monitoring of PrEP. Noted tangible barriers included inconsistent access to phone service and transportation. Primary supports included high levels of insurance coverage, consistent pharmacy access, and histories with successful medication management for other health conditions. Drawing on the critical perspectives of people with substance use disorder, our findings provide important and actionable information on individual and environmental barriers and facilitators of PrEP uptake among rural PWID at high risk for HIV infection. These data will drive the adaptation and implementation of a client-centered approach to integrated PrEP care within rurally located SSP settings to address unmet needs for PrEP care.", "final_rank": 35}

Prehabilitation has shown to be an important means of preparing patients both physically and psychologically for cancer treatment. However, little is understood about the context and mechanisms of prehabilitation that can impact physiological and psychological wellbeing. Our aim was to review and summarise primary research on prehabilitation in the lung cancer pathway using a realist approach. A scoping review of empirical primary research was conducted. Five online medical databases from 2016 \u2013 February 2023 were searched. All articles reporting on prehabilitation in lung cancer were included in the review. For this review, prehabilitation was defined as either a uni-modal or multi-modal intervention including exercise, nutrition and/or psychosocial support within a home, community or hospital based setting. A realist framework of context, mechanism and outcome was used to assist with the interpretation of findings. In total, 31 studies were included in the review, of which, three were published study protocols. Over 95% of studies featured an exercise component as part of a prehabilitation programme. Twenty-six of the studies had a surgical focus. Only two studies reported using theory to underpin the design of this complex intervention. There was large heterogeneity across all studies as well as a lack of clinical trials to provide definitive evidence on the programme design, setting, type of intervention, patient criteria, delivery, duration and outcome measures used. A standardised prehabilitation programme for lung cancer patients does not yet exist. Future lung cancer prehabilitation programmes should take into account patient led values, needs, goals, support structures and beliefs, as these factors can affect the delivery and engagement of interventions. Future research should consider using a conceptual framework to conceptualise the living with and beyond cancer experience to help shape and inform personalised prehabilitation services.", "final_rank": 41}

These harms occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, from extraction of the coal, oil, and gas that are its main feedstocks through to ultimate disposal into the environment. The extent of these harms not been systematically assessed, their magnitude not fully quantified, and their economic costs not comprehensively counted. The goals of this Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health are to comprehensively examine plastics\u2019 impacts across their life cycle on: (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations\u2014the poor, minorities, and the world\u2019s children. On the basis of this examination, the Commission offers science-based recommendations designed to support development of a Global Plastics Treaty, protect human health, and save lives. This Commission report contains seven Sections. Following an Introduction, Section 2 presents a narrative review of the processes involved in plastic production, use, and disposal and notes the hazards to human health and the environment associated with each of these stages. Section 3 describes plastics\u2019 impacts on the ocean and notes the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure. Section 4 details plastics\u2019 impacts on human health. Section 5 presents a first-order estimate of plastics\u2019 health-related economic costs. Section 6 examines the intersection between plastic, social inequity, and environmental injustice. Section 7 presents the Commission\u2019s findings and recommendations. Plastics are complex, highly heterogeneous, synthetic chemical materials. Over 98% of plastics are produced from fossil carbon- coal, oil and gas. Plastics are comprised of a carbon-based polymer backbone and thousands of additional chemicals that are incorporated into polymers to convey specific properties such as color, flexibility, stability, water repellence, flame retardation, and ultraviolet resistance. Many of these added chemicals are highly toxic. They include carcinogens, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate flame retardants. They are integral components of plastic and are responsible for many of plastics\u2019 harms to human health and the environment. Global plastic production has increased almost exponentially since World War II, and in this time more than 8,300 megatons (Mt) of plastic have been manufactured. Annual production volume has grown from under 2 Mt in 1950 to 460 Mt in 2019, a 230-fold increase, and is on track to triple by 2060. More than half of all plastic ever made has been produced since 2002. Single-use plastics account for 35\u201340% of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufacture. Explosive recent growth in plastics production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossil-carbon corporations that produce coal, oil and gas and that also manufacture plastics. These corporations are reducing their production of fossil fuels and increasing plastics manufacture. The two principal factors responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbon-based fuels due to increases in \u2018green\u2019 energy, and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to fracking. Plastic manufacture is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to climate change. At present, plastic production is responsible for an estimated 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the contribution of Brazil. This fraction is projected to increase to 4.5% by 2060 if current trends continue unchecked. The plastic life cycle has three phases: production, use, and disposal. In production, carbon feedstocks\u2014coal, gas, and oil\u2014are transformed through energy-intensive, catalytic processes into a vast array of products. Plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and results in widespread human exposure to the chemicals contained in plastic. Single-use plastics constitute the largest portion of current use, followed by synthetic fibers and construction. Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950. Strategies for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling, open burning, thermal conversion, and export. Vast quantities of plastic waste are exported each year from high-income to low-income countries, where it accumulates in landfills, pollutes air and water, degrades vital ecosystems, befouls beaches and estuaries, and harms human health\u2014environmental injustice on a global scale. Plastic-laden e-waste is particularly problematic. Plastics and plastic-associated chemicals are responsible for widespread pollution. They contaminate aquatic (marine and freshwater), terrestrial, and atmospheric environments globally. The ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic, and plastics are found throughout the ocean, including coastal regions, the sea surface, the deep sea, and polar sea ice. Many plastics appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decades. Macro- and micro-plastic particles have been identified in hundreds of marine species in all major taxa, including species consumed by humans. Trophic transfer of microplastic particles and the chemicals within them has been demonstrated. Although microplastic particles themselves (>10 \u00b5m) appear not to undergo biomagnification, hydrophobic plastic-associated chemicals bioaccumulate in marine animals and biomagnify in marine food webs. The amounts and fates of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particles (MNPs <10 \u00b5m) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological systems. Adverse environmental impacts of plastic pollution occur at multiple levels from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem. MNP contamination of seafood results in direct, though not well quantified, human exposure to plastics and plastic-associated chemicals. Marine plastic pollution endangers the ocean ecosystems upon which all humanity depends for food, oxygen, livelihood, and well-being. Coal miners, oil workers and gas field workers who extract fossil carbon feedstocks for plastic production suffer increased mortality from traumatic injury, coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, silicosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Plastic production workers are at increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, neurotoxic injury, and decreased fertility. Workers producing plastic textiles die of bladder cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and interstitial lung disease at increased rates. Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer. Residents of \u201cfenceline\u201d communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. During use and also in disposal, plastics release toxic chemicals including additives and residual monomers into the environment and into people. National biomonitoring surveys in the USA document population-wide exposures to these chemicals. Plastic additives disrupt endocrine function and increase risk for premature births, neurodevelopmental disorders, male reproductive birth defects, infertility, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cancers. Chemical-laden MNPs formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organisms, including humans. Emerging, albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that MNPs may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effects as well as by acting as vectors that transport toxic chemicals and bacterial pathogens into tissues and cells. Infants in the womb and young children are two populations at particularly high risk of plastic-related health effects. Because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemicals and children\u2019s unique patterns of exposure, plastic-associated exposures are linked to increased risks of prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, birth defects of the reproductive organs, neurodevelopmental impairment, impaired lung growth, and childhood cancer. Early-life exposures to plastic-associated chemicals also increase the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases later in life. Plastic\u2019s harms to human health result in significant economic costs. We estimate that in 2015 the health-related costs of plastic production exceeded $250 billion (2015 Int$) globally, and that in the USA alone the health costs of disease and disability caused by the plastic-associated chemicals PBDE, BPA and DEHP exceeded $920 billion (2015 Int$). Plastic production results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 1.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO These costs, large as they are, almost certainly underestimate the full economic losses resulting from plastics\u2019 negative impacts on human health and the global environment. All of plastics\u2019 economic costs\u2014and also its social costs\u2014are externalized by the petrochemical and plastic manufacturing industry and are borne by citizens, taxpayers, and governments in countries around the world without compensation. The adverse effects of plastics and plastic pollution on human health, the economy and the environment are not evenly distributed. They disproportionately affect poor, disempowered, and marginalized populations such as workers, racial and ethnic minorities, \u201cfenceline\u201d communities, Indigenous groups, women, and children, all of whom had little to do with creating the current plastics crisis and lack the political influence or the resources to address it. Plastics\u2019 harmful impacts across its life cycle are most keenly felt in the Global South, in small island states, and in disenfranchised areas in the Global North. Social and environmental justice (SEJ) principles require reversal of these inequitable burdens to ensure that no group bears a disproportionate share of plastics\u2019 negative impacts and that those who benefit economically from plastic bear their fair share of its currently externalized costs. It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices. The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in global plastic production. Plastics\u2019 harms are further magnified by low rates of recovery and recycling and by the long persistence of plastic waste in the environment. The thousands of chemicals in plastics\u2014monomers, additives, processing agents, and non-intentionally added substances\u2014include amongst their number known human carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, neurotoxicants, and persistent organic pollutants. These chemicals are responsible for many of plastics\u2019 known harms to human and planetary health. The chemicals leach out of plastics, enter the environment, cause pollution, and result in human exposure and disease. All efforts to reduce plastics\u2019 hazards must address the hazards of plastic-associated chemicals. To protect human and planetary health, especially the health of vulnerable and at-risk populations, and put the world on track to end plastic pollution by 2040, this Commission supports urgent adoption by the world\u2019s nations of a strong and comprehensive Global Plastics Treaty in accord with the mandate set forth in the March 2022 resolution of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA). International measures such as a Global Plastics Treaty are needed to curb plastic production and pollution, because the harms to human health and the environment caused by plastics, plastic-associated chemicals and plastic waste transcend national boundaries, are planetary in their scale, and have disproportionate impacts on the health and well-being of people in the world\u2019s poorest nations. Effective implementation of the Global Plastics Treaty will require that international action be coordinated and complemented by interventions at the national, regional, and local levels. This Commission urges that a cap on global plastic production with targets, timetables, and national contributions be a central provision of the Global Plastics Treaty. We recommend inclusion of the following additional provisions: The Treaty needs to extend beyond microplastics and marine litter to include all of the many thousands of chemicals incorporated into plastics. The Treaty needs to include a provision banning or severely restricting manufacture and use of unnecessary, avoidable, and problematic plastic items, especially single-use items such as manufactured plastic microbeads. The Treaty needs to include requirements on extended producer responsibility (EPR) that make fossil carbon producers, plastic producers, and the manufacturers of plastic products legally and financially responsible for the safety and end-of-life management of all the materials they produce and sell. The Treaty needs to mandate reductions in the chemical complexity of plastic products; health-protective standards for plastics and plastic additives; a requirement for use of sustainable non-toxic materials; full disclosure of all components; and traceability of components. International cooperation will be essential to implementing and enforcing these standards. The Treaty needs to include SEJ remedies at each stage of the plastic life cycle designed to fill gaps in community knowledge and advance both distributional and procedural equity. This Commission encourages inclusion in the Global Plastic Treaty of a provision calling for exploration of listing at least some plastic polymers as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention. This Commission encourages a strong interface between the Global Plastics Treaty and the Basel and London Conventions to enhance management of hazardous plastic waste and slow current massive exports of plastic waste into the world\u2019s least-developed countries. This Commission recommends the creation of a Permanent Science Policy Advisory Body to guide the Treaty\u2019s implementation. The main priorities of this Body would be to guide Member States and other stakeholders in evaluating which solutions are most effective in reducing plastic consumption, enhancing plastic waste recovery and recycling, and curbing the generation of plastic waste. This Body could also assess trade-offs among these solutions and evaluate safer alternatives to current plastics. It could monitor the transnational export of plastic waste. It could coordinate robust oceanic-, land-, and air-based MNP monitoring programs. This Commission recommends urgent investment by national governments in research into solutions to the global plastic crisis. This research will need to determine which solutions are most effective and cost-effective in the context of particular countries and assess the risks and benefits of proposed solutions. Oceanographic and environmental research is needed to better measure concentrations and impacts of plastics <10 \u00b5m and understand their distribution and fate in the global environment. Biomedical research is needed to elucidate the human health impacts of plastics, especially MNPs. This Commission finds that plastics are both a boon to humanity and a stealth threat to human and planetary health. Plastics convey enormous benefits, but current linear patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal that pay little attention to sustainable design or safe materials and a near absence of recovery, reuse, and recycling are responsible for grave harms to health, widespread environmental damage, great economic costs, and deep societal injustices. These harms are rapidly worsening. While there remain gaps in knowledge about plastics\u2019 harms and uncertainties about their full magnitude, the evidence available today demonstrates unequivocally that these impacts are great and that they will increase in severity in the absence of urgent and effective intervention at global scale. Manufacture and use of essential plastics may continue. However, reckless increases in plastic production, and especially increases in the manufacture of an ever-increasing array of unnecessary single-use plastic products, need to be curbed. Global intervention against the plastic crisis is needed now because the costs of failure to act will be immense.", "final_rank": 42}

In this study, we present the design and evaluation of NutriColoring, a food diary that leverages doodling on sketches to report and reflect on everyday diet in the working context. Through a 2-week field study involving 18 participants, the usefulness of NutriColoring in facilitating dietary assessment was tested by making comparisons with the typical bullet diary method. Our quantitative results showed that NutriColoring provided users with improved dietary assessment experience and intrinsic motivations, with significantly low task frustration and high enjoyment. Because of the freedom and playfulness in reporting intakes at work, the interview findings showed a high acceptance of employing NutriColoring at work.

Consumption of legumes has been linked to several health benefits, including a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and certain types of cancer, while legumes\u2019 high fiber content promotes digestive health. Aside from the positive health benefits, one of the most significant advantages of legumes is the low environmental footprint of their cultivation. They can be grown in a variety of climates and soil types, and they require less water and fertilizer than other crops, making them a sustainable option for farmers. Thanks to their nutritional and physicochemical properties, they are widely used by the food industry since the growing popularity of plant-based diets and the increasing demand for alternatives to meat offers the opportunity to develop legume-based meat substitutes. As the use of legumes as a source of protein becomes widespread, new market opportunities could be created for farmers and food industries, while the reduction in healthcare costs could have a potential economic impact. Achieving widespread adoption of legumes as a sustainable source of protein requires coordinated efforts by individuals, governments, and the private sector. The objective of this narrative review is to present the benefits coming from legume consumption in terms of health and environmental sustainability, and underline the importance of promoting their inclusion in the daily dietary pattern as well as their use as functional ingredients and plant-based alternatives to animal products.", "final_rank": 45}

While there have been many studies examining interventions during the complementary feeding period, there is an overall lack of relevant information through which to draw conclusions on the ideal feeding schedule by food type. Similarly, few studies have examined the effects of animal milk versus infant formula for non-breastfed infants (6\u201311 months), though those that did found a greater risk of anemia among infants who were provided cow\u2019s milk.

However, its clinical use is limited in several countries due to the possible occurrence of hepatotoxicity, mainly in the form of mild to moderate transaminase elevation. It is worth noting that only a few cases of severe hepatotoxicity have been described in the literature, with no reported cases of liver failure. Data available on coumarin absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion have been reviewed, focusing on hepatotoxicity studies carried out in vitro and in vivo. Finally, safety and tolerability data from clinical trials have been thoroughly discussed. Based on these data, coumarin-induced hepatotoxicity is restricted to a small subset of patients, probably due to the activation in these individuals of alternative metabolic pathways involving specific CYP450s isoforms. The aim of this work is to stimulate research to clearly identify patients at risk of developing hepatotoxicity following coumarin treatment. Early identification of this subset of patients could open the possibility of more safely exploiting the therapeutical properties of coumarin, allowing patients suffering from lymphoedema to benefit from the anti-oedematous activity of the treatment.", "final_rank": 52}

In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, several behavioral change and policy initiatives such as physical distancing have been implemented to control the spread of COVID-19. Social media data can reveal public perceptions toward how governments and health agencies worldwide are handling the pandemic, and the impact of the disease on people regardless of their geographic locations in line with various factors that hinder or facilitate the efforts to control the spread of the pandemic globally. This paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people worldwide using social media data. We applied natural language processing (NLP) and thematic analysis to understand public opinions, experiences, and issues with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. First, we collected over 47 million COVID-19\u2013related comments from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and three online discussion forums. Second, we performed data preprocessing, which involved applying NLP techniques to clean and prepare the data for automated key phrase extraction. Third, we applied the NLP approach to extract meaningful key phrases from over 1 million randomly selected comments and computed sentiment score for each key phrase and assigned sentiment polarity (ie, positive, negative, or neutral) based on the score using a lexicon-based technique. Fourth, we grouped related negative and positive key phrases into categories or broad themes. A total of 34 negative themes emerged, out of which 15 were health-related issues, psychosocial issues, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic from the public perspective. Some of the health-related issues were We uncovered various negative and positive themes representing public perceptions toward the COVID-19 pandemic and recommended interventions that can help address the health, psychosocial, and social issues based on the positive themes and other research evidence. These interventions will help governments, health professionals and agencies, institutions, and individuals in their efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and minimize its impact, and in reacting to any future pandemics.", "final_rank": 53}

While previously published studies of modified fasting in cancer patients exclusively enrolled patients receiving chemotherapy, in our trial, we also accrued patients treated with different types of therapies, including endocrine therapies (w/ or w/o CDK4/6 inhibitors), TKIs, proteasome inhibitors, immune check point inhibitors and radiotherapy. Eighteen different types of cancer are represented in our trial. Our study also shows that the FMD decreased fat mass and effectively lowered the circulating insulin, IGF1 and leptin. These are important elements of novelty of our study when compared to previously published trials. In preclinical studies, fasting was found to potentiate the effects of several anticancer treatments, and early clinical studies indicated that patients may benefit from regimes of modified fasting. However, concerns remain over possible negative impact on the patients\u2019 nutritional status. We assessed the feasibility and safety of a 5-day \u201cFasting-Mimicking Diet\u201d (FMD) as well as its effects on body composition and circulating growth factors, adipokines and cyto/chemokines in cancer patients. In this single-arm, phase I/II clinical trial, patients with solid or hematologic malignancy, low nutritional risk and undergoing active medical treatment received periodic FMD cycles. The body weight, handgrip strength and body composition were monitored throughout the study. Growth factors, adipokines and cyto/chemokines were assessed by ELISA. Ninety patients were enrolled, and FMD was administered every three weeks/once a month with an average of 6.3 FMD cycles/patient. FMD was largely safe with only mild side effects. The patients\u2019 weight and handgrip remained stable, the phase angle and fat-free mass increased, while the fat mass decreased. FMD reduced the serum c-peptide, IGF1, IGFBP3 and leptin levels, while increasing IGFBP1, and these modifications persisted for weeks beyond the FMD period. Thus, periodic FMD cycles are feasible and can be safely combined with standard antineoplastic treatments in cancer patients at low nutritional risk. The FMD resulted in reduced fat mass, insulin production and circulating IGF1 and leptin. This trial was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov in July 2018 with the identifier NCT03595540.", "final_rank": 54}

The pilot feasibility study only included adult pregnant women enrolled during the first 2 pregnancy trimesters. The 3 codesign LSs (n = 21 participants) showed that participants thought good nutrition was very important during pregnancy and were very interested in having skill-building nutrition classes as part of the PRx. Most participants preferred receiving incentives through the Fresh Connect card to allow them to choose their produce. They also recognized that some participants with limited transportation options may benefit from a produce box delivered at home. All pilot study participants chose the electronic benefit transfer card as their incentive redemption channel. The redemption rate of benefits by pilot participants was 70% and they felt that F4M helped them and their families consume more produce.

A special type of intermittent fasting occurs during Ramadan, when Muslims worldwide fast daily from dawn to sunset for a month. Ramadan fasting has demonstrated several health benefits, including improving the gut microbiome, modifying gut hormone levels, and lowering proinflammatory markers such as cytokines and blood lipids. Although fasting has many health benefits, fasting during Ramadan may aggravate chronic medical conditions. We aim to review the literature devoted to Ramadan fasting and its effects on Muslim patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, such as Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), upper GI bleeding (UGIB), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and liver conditions. We will discuss recommendations for diet and medication compliance during Ramadan in the recommended pre-Ramadan counseling sessions. In this study, we used PubMed to research journals using the key terms \"Ramadan,\" \"intermittent fasting,\" and \"gastrointestinal diseases.\" The current literature studying the impact of Ramadan on gastrointestinal disorders shows that patients with IBD have a minimal risk of disease exacerbation, although older men with ulcerative colitis (UC) were more prone to exacerbation during fasting. Patients with duodenal ulcers were at a higher risk of hemorrhage after Ramadan fasting. Although with mixed results, studies show patients with liver disease demonstrated improvements in liver enzymes, cholesterol, and bilirubin after Ramadan. Physicians should offer pre-Ramadan counseling to educate patients on the risks of fasting and encourage shared decision-making. To facilitate more definitive discussions between the physician and a Muslim patient, clinicians should seek a deeper understanding of how Ramadan fasting affects certain health conditions and offer accommodations, such as diet and medication adjustments.", "final_rank": 67}

Key survivor themes included perception of Mexican diet as unhealthy, need for reliable diet-related information, perceived benefits of physical activity after cancer treatment, family support for healthy lifestyles (physical and emotional), presence of cancer-related symptoms interfering with lifestyle, and financial barriers to living a healthy lifestyle. Among caregivers, key themes included effects of the cancer caregiving experience on caregivers\u2019 lifestyle and cancer-preventive behaviors and gratification in providing support to the survivors.

A descriptive analysis of a case series of ten patients admitted to HUCSH between May 25th and July 18th, 2023, and on-site observational study of 67 patients over one month. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data, and SPSS version 25 was used for analysis. From the case series, all of the ten patients had either unilateral or bilateral leg swelling or pain as common compliant and all of them were male prisoners with mean age of 25.6\u00b15.33 years and following admission, the hemoglobin value increased to 7.1\u00b11.34 g/dL with treatment from 4.6\u00b11.88 g/dL. From observational study of the prison, 67 cases were identified based on unilateral or bilateral leg swelling and/or pain, which was the presenting feature in the cluster of cases seen at HUCSH. The mean age was 23.57\u00b16.4 years, and each patient got therapeutic doses of ascorbic acid 500mg PO daily using directly observed therapy and follow-up visit was after two and four weeks of ascorbic acid initiation and all patients showed significant improvement. For clinicians in modern medicine, there should be a high index of suspicion for scurvy as a possible differential diagnosis when a patient presents with leg swelling in high-risk population, such as prisoners. Health-care providers in prison clinics need to be alert to such forgotten yet life-costly disease in resource constrained prison clinics.", "final_rank": 73}

To do that, we firstly collect a large-scale dataset of Reddit posts and annotate it with highly trained and expert annotators under a rigorous annotation scheme. Next, we perform a multifaceted analysis of the dataset, including: (1) the analysis of user activity before and after posting a suicidal message, and (2) a pragmalinguistic study on the vocabulary used by suicidal users. In the second part of the analysis, we apply LIWC, a dictionary-based toolset widely used in psychology and linguistic research, which provides a wide range of linguistic category annotations on text. However, since raw LIWC scores are not sufficiently reliable, or informative, we propose a procedure to decrease the possibility of unreliable and misleading LIWC scores leading to misleading conclusions by analyzing not each category separately, but in pairs with other categories. The analysis of the results supported the validity of the proposed approach by revealing a number of valuable information on the vocabulary used by suicidal users and helped to pin-point false predictors. For example, we were able to specify that death-related words, typically associated with suicidal posts in the majority of the literature, become false predictors, when they co-occur with apostrophes, even in high-risk subreddits. On the other hand, the category-pair based disambiguation helped to specify that death becomes a predictor only when co-occurring with future-focused language, informal language, discrepancy, or 1st person pronouns. The promising applicability of the approach was additionally analyzed for its limitations, where we found out that although LIWC is a useful and easily applicable tool, the lack of any contextual processing makes it unsuitable for application in psychological and linguistic studies. We conclude that disadvantages of LIWC can be easily overcome by creating a number of high-performance AI-based classifiers trained for annotation of similar categories as LIWC, which we plan to pursue in future work.", "final_rank": 79}

This project utilized a human-centered design methodology to plan and implement a nutrition-focused community-health-worker (CHW) intervention in permanent supportive housing (PSH). The project aimed to increase access to healthy foods, improve nutritional literacy, healthy cooking/eating practices, and build community/social connectedness among 140 PSH residents. Validated food-security screening conducted by CHWs identified low or very low food security among 64% of 83 residents who completed the baseline survey, which is similar to rates found in a previous study among formerly homeless populations placed in PSH. Major themes identified through an analysis of resident feedback include (1) lack of needed kitchenware/appliances for food preparation, (2) knowledge gaps on how to purchase and prepare healthier food, (3) positive perceptions of healthy food options, (4) expanded preferences for healthy, easy-to-prepare foods, (5) regaining cooking skills lost during homelessness, (6) positive experiences participating in group activities, (7) community re-entry, and (8) resident ownership. Preliminary findings suggest the use of a human-centered design methodology for planning and implementing this multi-level CHW intervention helped reduce food insecurity, engaged participants in learning and adopting healthy and safe cooking and eating practices, and fostered social connectedness and feelings of community among formerly chronically homeless PSH residents.", "final_rank": 80}

The highest burden is in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where the prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy is 41.7% and 40%, respectively. Anaemia in pregnancy can lead to complications such as prematurity, low birthweight, spontaneous abortion, and foetal death, as well as increasing the likelihood and severity of postpartum haemorrhage. Identifying and mitigating anaemia in pregnancy is a public health priority. Here we present a mixed-methods situational analysis of facility readiness and community understanding of anaemia in Ghana and Uganda. Quantitative health assessments (adapted from service availability and readiness assessments) and qualitative key informant interviews (KIIs) with district-level stakeholders, in-depth interviews (IDIs) with maternity staff, and focus group discussions (FGDs) with community members were held in 2021. We carried out facility assessments in nine facilities in Ghana and seven in Uganda. We carried out seven KIIs, 23 IDIs, and eight FGDs in Ghana and nine, 17, and five, respectively, in Uganda. Many good practices and general awareness of anaemia in pregnancy were identified. In terms of bottlenecks, there was broad consistency across both countries. In health facilities, there were gaps in the availability of haemoglobin testing\u2014especially point-of-care testing\u2014staffing numbers, availability of standard operating procedures/guidelines for anaemia in pregnancy, and poor staff attitudes during antenatal care. Amongst community members, there was a need for improved sensitisation around malaria and helminth infections as potential causes of anaemia and provision of education around the purpose of iron and folic acid supplementation for preventing or managing anaemia in pregnancy.

Our second aim was to explore demographic and environmental risk factors across individuals from the four best-sampled species. We found a potential ecological explanation for susceptibility to captive weight gain: being adapted to unpredictable wild food resources. Additionally, we also revealed one environmental and four demographic risk factors, e.g., increasing age and, for males, being housed with only fixed climbing structures. Our results indicate targeted practical ways to help address weight issues in affected animals, e.g., by highlighting at-risk species for whom extra care should be taken when designing diets; and by providing a mixture of flexible and fixed climbing structures within enclosures. Excessive body mass, i.e., being overweight or obese, is a health concern associated with issues such as reduced fertility and lifespan. Some lemur species are prone to extreme weight gain in captivity, yet others are not. To better understand species- and individual-level effects on susceptibility to captive weight gain, we use two complementary methods: phylogenetic comparative methods to examine ecological explanations for susceptibility to weight gain across species, and epidemiological approaches to examine demographic and environment effects within species. Data on body masses and living conditions were collected using a survey, yielding useable data on 675 lemurs representing 13 species from 96 collections worldwide. Data on species-typical wild ecology for comparative analyses came from published literature and climate databases. We uncovered one potential ecological risk factor: species adapted to greater wild food resource unpredictability tended to be more prone to weight gain. Our epidemiological analyses on the four best-sampled species revealed four demographic and one environmental risk factors, e.g., for males, being housed with only fixed climbing structures. We make practical recommendations to help address weight concerns, and describe future research including ways to validate the proxy we used to infer body condition.", "final_rank": 85}

Over the last decade, several tumor ablation strategies have emerged as stand-alone or combination therapies. Histotripsy is the first completely non-invasive, non-thermal, and non-ionizing tumor ablation method. Histotripsy can produce consistent and rapid ablations, even near critical structures. Additional benefits include real-time image-guidance, high precision, and the ability to treat tumors of any predetermined size and shape. Unfortunately, the lack of clinically and physiologically relevant pre-clinical cancer models is often a significant limitation with all focal tumor ablation strategies. The majority of studies testing histotripsy for cancer treatment have focused on small animal models, which have been critical in moving this field forward and will continue to be essential for providing mechanistic insight. While these small animal models have notable translational value, there are significant limitations in terms of scale and anatomical relevance. To address these limitations, a diverse range of large animal models and spontaneous tumor studies in veterinary patients have emerged to complement existing rodent models. These models and veterinary patients are excellent at providing realistic avenues for developing and testing histotripsy devices and techniques designed for future use in human patients. Here, we provide a review of animal models used in preclinical histotripsy studies and compare histotripsy ablation in these models using a series of original case reports across a broad spectrum of preclinical animal models and spontaneous tumors in veterinary patients.", "final_rank": 89}

Food banks, a growing part of the charitable food system (CFS), are the main source of food relief in developed countries. Donations of surplus, unsalable food from supermarkets, producers and manufacturers is the main source of the food supply, and this can be unpredictable, insufficient and inappropriate. The universal performance indicator of food-banking success is a weight-based measure, complemented by various initiatives to track the nutritional quality of food provided. There is currently no method that assesses the dietary risk of donated food related to nutrition and food safety. This protocol describes a method developed to identify and assess the dietary risk of donated food at an Australian food bank including the type, amount, nutrition quality, and food safety. An audit of all food donated to a food bank servicing one Australian state was conducted over five consecutive days in May 2022. The audit process used a mobile device to take photographs of all incoming deliveries to the food bank. The images were manually annotated to document the type of food, product information (brand and product name, variety), the donor\u2019s name, weight (kilograms), and date-marking details. Data was extracted from the photographs and assessed against pre-determined dietary risk criterion for food safety (date marking, damaged packaging, visible food spoilage) and nutrition quality according to the principles of the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, and the NOVA classification of level of processing. Fifteen hundred images were required to assess the dietary risk of 86,050\u00a0kg of donated food. There were 72 separate donations, largely from supermarkets and food manufacturers. Data analysis will enable identification of dietary risk, particularly for nutrition quality and food safety. This is important given the absence of food regulation for CFS donations, and the vulnerability of the client group.

Further translation of RNA therapies to the clinic\nwill improve the treatment of many diseases and help enable personalized\nmedicine. However, in vivo delivery of RNA remains challenging due\nto the lack of appropriate delivery tools. Current state-of-the-art\ncarriers such as ionizable lipid nanoparticles still face significant\nchallenges, including frequent localization to clearance-associated\norgans and limited (1\u20132%) endosomal escape. Thus, delivery\nvehicles must be improved to further unlock the full potential of\nRNA therapeutics. An emerging strategy is to modify existing or new\nlipid nanocarriers by incorporating bioinspired design principles.\nThis method generally aims to improve tissue targeting, cellular uptake,\nand endosomal escape, addressing some of the critical issues facing\nthe field. In this review, we introduce the different strategies for\ncreating bioinspired lipid-based RNA carriers and discuss the potential\nimplications of each strategy based on reported findings. These strategies\ninclude incorporating naturally derived lipids into existing nanocarriers\nand mimicking bioderived molecules, viruses, and exosomes. We evaluate\neach strategy based on the critical factors required for delivery\nvehicles to succeed. Finally, we point to areas of research that should\nbe furthered to enable the more successful rational design of lipid\nnanocarriers for RNA delivery.", "final_rank": 94}

Also, to identify obesogenic and unhealthy behaviors (e.g.diet/sleep quality, physical activity, screen time, smoking) associated with short sleep duration and late bedtime. Participants (n=755) were part of exploratory, population-based research, with data collection in a virtual environment. For purposes of characterizing the population we considered short sleepers<7h/night, and the population bedtime median was used to stratify participants into early and late sleepers (before and after 23:08). Student's t-test and chi-square test were performed to assess differences in characteristics between groups. Linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the association of sleep duration, bedtime, and wake-up time with BMI. Quantile regression was estimated for the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles to identify the distributional correlations between BMI and sleep variables. Restricted cubic splines were also used to study the shape of the association between sleep-BMI. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounding variables. BMI decreased by 0.40Kg/m2 for each additional hour of sleep duration [95%CI=-0.68,-0.12,p=0.005] and increased by 0.37\u00a0kg/m Because we found that beyond sleep duration, bedtime was significantly associated with BMI, our data reflect the pertinence of assessing sleep timing patterns in disentangling sleep-obesity association. Insights into the characteristics, obesogenic and unhealthy behaviors related to short and late sleep may support specific strategies to prevent and treat excess body adiposity and other negative health outcomes.", "final_rank": 95}

The \u201cCardboard Grannies\u201d in Hong Kong are informal waste pickers (IWPs) who represent a unique sub-group that is often forgotten in society. This group has unique social and economic conditions and contributions that are not monitored and recognized. Leaving no one behind in healthy ageing requires an understanding of the needs and contributions of those on the margins of society, like older adult IWPs. This study answers two main research questions: (i) what are the service needs of the older adult IWPs and (ii) what are their contributions (social impact)? Qualitative methods were used to collect data from the older adult IWPs and key informants. Thematic analysis and word clouds were used to analyse the data. Nine themes were identified, providing relevant and significant insight into the service needs of the older adult IWPs. Two themes were identified, providing insight into the contributions (social impact) of the older adult IWPs. These themes inform recommendations that cover a range of individual, family, and community service responses to address healthy ageing of this unique sub-group.", "final_rank": 96}

This study explores the experiences and perceptions of patients and family members on the effectiveness of a decentralised community DR-TB care model in the Oliver Reginald Kaizana (OR) Tambo district municipality of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. In this phenomenological qualitative research design, a semi-structured interview with prompts was conducted on 30 participants (15 patients and 15 family members). Framework approach to thematic content analysis was adopted for qualitative data analysis. Four themes emerged from the patients\u2019 interviews: adequate knowledge of DR-TB and its transmission, fear of death and isolation, long travel distances, and exorbitant transportation cost. A \u2018ready\u2019 health system influenced the effectiveness of community DR-TB management, while interviews with family members yielded five themes: misconceptions about DR-TB, rapid diagnosis and adherence counselling, long travel distances, activated healthcare workers, and little role of traditional healer. A perceived effectiveness of a community DR-TB care model in the OR Tambo district was demonstrated through the quality and comprehensiveness of care rendered by a \u2018ready\u2019 health system with activated health care workers (HCWs) who provided robust support and adequate knowledge of DR-TB and its treatment/side effects. However, misconceptions about DR-TB, long travel distances to treatment facilities, high cost of transportation and stigma remained challenging for most patients and family members. This study provides insight into the lived experiences of a decentralised community DR-TB care model in the OR Tambo district in 2020.", "final_rank": 98}

The aim of this review was to scope FN constructs that have been studied internationally regarding teacher FN-related health and wellbeing. Six databases were searched, and papers extracted in June/July 2021. Eligibility criteria guided by the population, concept, context mnemonic included studies published after 2000, in English language, with an aspect of personal FN-related health and wellbeing, among in-service (practising) and pre-service (training), primary, and secondary teachers. Screening studies for inclusion was completed by two independent researchers with data extraction piloted with the same reviewers and completed by lead author, along with complete descriptive and thematic analysis. Ten thousand six hundred seventy-seven unique articles were identified with 368 eligible for full text review and 105 included in final extraction and analysis.

The science surrounding dietary supplements has evolved substantially over the last few decades since their formal regulation in 1994. Much has been learned about the mechanisms of action of many dietary supplement ingredients, but the evidence on their health effects is still building. As is true of much nutrition research, there are many studies that point to health effects, but not all are at the level of scientific evidence (e.g., randomized controlled interventions), rigor, or quality needed for definitive statements of efficacy regarding clinical end points. New technologies and approaches are being applied to the science of dietary supplements, including nutrigenomics and microbiome analysis, data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning\u2014all of which can elevate the science behind dietary supplements. Products can contain an array of bioactive compounds derived from foods as well as from medicinal plants, which creates enormous challenges in data collection and management. Clinical applications, particularly those aimed at providing personalized nutrition options for patients, have become more sophisticated as dietary supplements are incorporated increasingly into clinical practice and self-care. The goals of this article are to provide historical context for the regulation and science of dietary supplements, identify research resources, and suggest some future directions for science in this field.", "final_rank": 100}
