With sea creatures making up approximately half of all living organisms on the planet, seas, and oceans present many innovative materials and are believed to hold the most substantial remaining reserve of beneficial natural compounds. Seafood provides a plentiful supply of essential nutrients, including high\u2010quality protein, various fatty acids (such as omega\u20103s), and bioactive compounds like taurine, carotenoids, and phytosterols, all contributing to its numerous health advantages. Furthermore, seafood contains bio\u2010lipopeptides, polysaccharides, and phenolic compounds, and it promotes health through its antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory effects. Enzymes, vitamins, and minerals further enrich its nutritional profile, supporting various metabolic processes and overall well\u2010being. This review emphasizes the health benefits of seafood consumption, encompassing its cardio\u2010protective effects that bolster heart health, its antidiabetic properties that aid in regulating blood sugar levels and its anti\u2010cancer effects that may lower the risk of specific cancers. Additionally, seafood contributes to anti\u2010obesity effects, enhances brain health, delivers antioxidative activity to combat oxidative stress, and supports maternal care during pregnancy and lactation."}

Epidemiological data link body weight and parameters of central fat distribution to an increasing risk for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, obstructive sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis, mental disorders and some types of cancer. However, the individual risk to develop cardiometabolic and other obesity\u2010related diseases cannot entirely be explained by increased fat mass. Rather than excess fat accumulation, dysfunction of adipose tissue may represent the mechanistic link between obesity and adverse health outcomes. There are people living with obesity who seem to be protected against the premature development of cardiometabolic diseases. On the other hand, people with normal weight may develop typical obesity diseases upon dysfunction of adipose tissue and predominantly visceral fat distribution. The mechanisms linking impaired function of adipose tissue in people with obesity include adipocyte hypertrophy, altered cellular composition, limited expandability of safe subcutaneous fat stores, ectopic fat deposition in visceral depots, the liver and other organs, hypoxia, a variety of stresses, inflammatory processes, and the release of pro\u2010inflammatory, diabetogenic and atherogenic signals. Genetic and environmental factors might contribute either alone or via interaction with intrinsic biological factors to variation in adipose tissue function. There are still many open questions regarding the mechanisms of how increased body weight causes obesity\u2010related disorders and whether these pathologies could be reversed. Evidence\u2010based weight loss interventions using behaviour change, pharmacological or surgical approaches have clarified the beneficial effects of realistic and sustained weight loss on obesity\u2010related complications as hard outcomes. This review focusses on recent advances in understanding epidemiological trends and mechanisms of obesity\u2010related diseases. Obesity is a chronic complex and progressive disease characterized by excessive fat deposition that may impair health and quality of life. Worldwide, the number of adults living with obesity has more than doubled since 1990. Obesity may lead to reduced life expectancy, because it increases the risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (e.g., myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, stroke), fatty liver diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, depression and certain types of cancer. However, not every person with obesity develops these diseases. For better prevention and treatment, it is important to understand the mechanisms linking high fat mass to obesity related diseases. It has become clear that fat mass alone cannot explain the higher risk of obesity complications. People with obesity can have either high or low risk of developing complications. Compared to people with a low risk for obesity complications those with a high risk to develop obesity related diseases are characterized by higher central fat deposition in the abdominal region, on average bigger fat cells, higher number of immune cells in adipose tissue and altered signals released from adipose tissue that may directly affect the brain, liver, vasculature and other organs. Both inherited and environment factors may cause these abnormalities of adipose tissue function. However, weight loss through behaviour changes (e.g., lower calorie intake, higher physical activity), medications or obesity surgery can improve health, quality of life and reduce the risk for obesity related diseases."}

This narrative review explores the potential of probiotics and plant-based foods as alternative or complementary preventive strategies against UTIs. Fermented foods, such as yogurt, kefir, and kombucha, contain probiotic strains that can modulate the gut and urogenital microbiota, enhancing resistance to uropathogens. Likewise, plant-based foods, including cranberry, garlic, bearberry, juniper, and nettle, possess bioactive compounds with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic properties. Laboratory and clinical studies suggest that these natural interventions may reduce the incidence of UTIs by inhibiting pathogen adhesion, modulating immune responses, and promoting urinary tract health. However, despite promising findings, inconsistencies in study methodologies, dosage standardization, and long-term efficacy warrant further investigation. Future research should focus on optimizing probiotic formulations, standardizing plant-based supplement dosages, and assessing potential food\u2013drug interactions to establish evidence-based guidelines for UTI prevention."}

Owing to its strong association with metabolic disorders, current management focuses on weight reduction via lifestyle modifications. Recently, the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) has emerged as a promising intervention due to its potential for rapid weight loss and reduction in liver fat. This review aims to evaluate the clinical evidence regarding the impact of ketogenic diets on hepatic steatosis. We conducted an extensive MEDLINE literature search in databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to December 2024. Studies assessing the effects of ketogenic or low-carbohydrate high-fat diets on liver fat, evaluated by imaging, histology, or biochemical markers, were included. The analysis indicates that ketogenic diets significantly reduce hepatic fat content and improve metabolic parameters, including insulin sensitivity and liver enzyme levels. Evidence further suggests that substituting saturated fats with unsaturated fats or replacing carbohydrates with proteins may enhance these benefits. However, considerable variability exists among studies and long-term data remain limited. Although short-term outcomes are encouraging, potential adverse effects such as dyslipidaemia, gastrointestinal disturbances, and transient \u2018keto flu\u2019 symptoms require careful clinical monitoring. Future research should focus on elucidating underlying mechanisms, optimizing dietary composition, and assessing long-term safety to establish ketogenic diets as a robust strategy for managing MASLD."}

This research seeks to explore the relationship between the antioxidant and pro-inflammatory properties of diet and the risk of all-cause mortality among cancer survivors. Adults aged 20 and above who had been diagnosed with cancer and participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2001 to 2018 were selected for this study. Their survival status was verified using death certificate information from the National Death Index. The study employed two established measures, the Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index (CDAI) and the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), to evaluate the antioxidant and inflammatory properties of participants\u2019 diets. A non-linear association between these two dietary indices and mortality was examined respectively using restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression. To quantify the relationship between the indices and mortality risk, multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were employed, generating hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Furthermore, the study also explored the connection between the CDAI and DII. In this study, a total of 3,507 cancer survivors, representing an estimated 20,016,255 cancer survivors in the US, were included in the baseline analysis. The results showed that patients with lower DII or higher CDAI values had better survival rates. RCS regression revealed that both indicators showed linear relationships with all-cause mortality in the crude and adjusted models. It was consistently noted higher CDAI or lower DII was related to a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in cancer survivors in the Cox regression. Moreover, the subgroup analysis demonstrated that these associations hold true across various subgroups, lending credibility to the overall findings of the study. At last, an inverse correlation was observed between CDAI and DII in the diets of cancer survivors. The research suggests that adopting a diet that low in pro-inflammatory foods and high in antioxidants may lower the all-cause mortality in cancer survivors. However, further prospective cohort studies are necessary to confirm these findings."}

It is associated with adverse short- and long-term cardiometabolic outcomes for both mother and infant. Effective management of GDM involves lifestyle modifications, including medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and physical activity (PA), with the addition of insulin or metformin if glycaemic control remains inadequate. However, substantial gaps persist in the determination of optimal medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for women with GDM. Challenges in MNT include individual variation in glucose tolerance and changing maternal physiology and dietary requirements during pregnancy. Achieving optimal glycaemic control depends on careful macronutrient balance, particularly the distribution and quality of carbohydrate intake and sufficient protein and fat intake. Additionally, micronutrient deficiencies, such as inadequate vitamin D, calcium, and essential minerals, may exacerbate oxidative stress, inflammation, and glycaemic dysregulation, further impacting foetal growth and development. Cultural beliefs and dietary practices among pregnant women can also hinder adherence to recommended nutritional guidelines. Conditions like hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) affect ~1% to 2% of pregnant women can result in unintended energy and nutrient deficits. This special issue explores the current evidence and major barriers to optimising dietary therapy for women with GDM.

Although there were no consistent associations among those with advanced disease, among those with earlier stage (local/regional) disease, higher scores on the alternate Healthy Eating Index (aHR quartile 4 compared with 1 = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.87), Healthy Eating Index-2015 (aHR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.97), and alternate Mediterranean diet (aHR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.98) were associated with better survival. Better survival was also observed for individuals with early-stage disease who reported higher intakes of dietary components that contribute to the healthy diet indices (aHR for Q4 compared with Q1: vegetables 0.71; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.91), tomatoes (aHR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.91) and nuts and seeds (aHR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.92).

Premature CAD (pCAD) is the term used to describe the 3\u201310% of CAD occurrences that occur in people under 45 worldwide. Diagnostic difficulties arise from the different risk factor profiles of pCAD and late-onset CAD. Better cardiovascular risk prediction in younger populations has been made possible by the development of biomarker detection tools. This can be applied to a diagnostic tool, including electrochemical biosensors, which have been predicted to be instrumental because of their adaptability for point-of-care applications for quicker diagnoses. These biosensors provide efficient, scalable, and reasonably priced solutions for the quick identification and tracking of CAD. Multiplex biomarker detection has been adopted as a viable approach for early diagnosis and risk assessment due to the constraints of using a single biomarker for pCAD diagnosis. Thus, this study looks at current developments in biosensing technology and discusses established and new cardiac biomarker panels for pCAD identification."}

This study examines how HIV and omega-3 fatty acids influence sex differences in hippocampal volume and explores whether cognitive performance related to episodic memory modifies the association of omega-3 levels with hippocampal volume, considering both HIV status and sex. We enrolled 166 participants aged over 45 years from a Baltimore, Maryland cohort. Brain MRIs were performed using a 3.0-T Siemens scanner, and volumetric segmentation was conducted with FreeSurfer (version 6.0), adjusting for intracranial volume (ICV). Our study found that: (1) Among HIV-negative participants, females had significantly lower hippocampal volumes than males in 1 of 26 regions, whereas HIV-positive females had lower volumes in 13 of 26 regions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.006 for HIV-negative vs. HIV-positive females), (2) In HIV-positive individuals with EPA levels \u22640.40\u00a0%, females exhibited lower volumes in 11 of 26 regions, compared to no differences in those with EPA levels >0.40\u00a0% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003 for \u22640.40\u00a0% vs. >0.40\u00a0%), (3) Across all participants, lower EPA and DHA levels were associated with greater sex differences in hippocampal volumes, which diminished or disappeared at higher EPA and DHA levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.00001 for EPA \u22640.40\u00a0% vs. >0.40\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004 for DHA \u22642.0\u00a0% vs. >2.0\u00a0%), and (4) Among Adults with lower episodic memory, higher log-scaled EPA levels were independently associated with greater hippocampal volume. HIV may amplify sex differences in hippocampal volumes, disproportionately affecting females. Higher EPA and DHA levels may mitigate these effects, suggesting a protective role against hippocampal atrophy. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore whether the benefits extend to males with HIV or individuals without HIV."}

Thereby, thiamin represents an essential vitamin to human health and is involved in several pathways that regulate several pathophysiological mechanisms. Cardiovascular disease is significantly impacted by thiamine imbalance and its supplementation offers substantial improvements to the associated conditions. In this comprehensive review, we aimed to examine the dual role of thiamine deficiency and accumulation, focusing on an analysis of the causes of thiamine deficiency. We detailed the effects of thiamine deficiency on metabolism and on cardiovascular risk and heart failure, explaining the molecular mechanisms involved in metabolic dysfunction, and highlighting the role of B1 vitamin supplementation in diabetes mellitus management and atherosclerosis development and progression. Indeed, B1 supplementation counteracts oxidative stress and inflammation, significantly ameliorating glycemic and lipemic profiles. Additionally, we reported the beneficial effects of thiamine in counteracting cardiotoxicity induced by cancer therapy. Although preclinical data strongly support the benefits of thiamine, clinical trial findings are in contrast and contradictory, hampered by limitations such as small sample sizes and inadequate follow-up. Further research is needed to investigate thiamine\u2019s potential benefits, overcoming current study limitations and evaluating its use as a supplemental therapy alongside standard treatments in different high-cardiovascular-risk conditions."}

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by the abnormal deposition of extracellular amyloid \u03b2\u2010protein (A\u03b2) and the aggregation of intracellular Tau protein to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Given the limited efficacy of pharmacological treatment, scientists have already paid more attention to non\u2010pharmacological strategies, including dietary restriction (DR). DR refers to a nutritional paradigm aimed at promoting overall health by modifying the balance between energy consumption and expenditure. Studies have demonstrated that DR effectively extends the healthy lifespan, delays the aging process, and achieves promising results in the prevention and treatment of AD in preclinical studies. In this review we collected related studies and viewpoints by searching on PubMed database using the keywords. Most of the citations were published between 2015 and 2025. A few older literatures were also included due to their relevance and significance in this field. We first provide a concise overview of the current therapeutic and preventive strategies for AD. Then, we introduce several specific DR protocols and their favorable effects on AD. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms underlying the benefits of DR on AD are discussed. Finally, we briefly highlight the role of DR in maintaining brain health.

It supplies our organisms with essential amino acids, which are needed for the growth and maintenance of cells and tissues. Conventional protein sources, despite their complete amino acid profiles and excellent digestibility, have a proven negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, their production poses many ethical challenges. This review aims to present nutritional, more ethical, and environmentally friendly alternatives that could serve as potential protein sources for the population. The available literature on alternative protein sources has been analyzed. Based on the research conducted, various products have been identified and described, including plant-based protein sources such as soybeans, peas, faba beans, lupins, and hemp seeds; aquatic sources such as algae, microalgae, and water lentils; as well as insect-based and microbial protein sources, and cell-cultured meat. Despite numerous advantages, such as a lower environmental impact, higher ethical standards of production, and beneficial nutritional profiles, alternative protein sources are not without limitations. These include lower bioavailability of certain amino acids, the presence of antinutritional compounds, technological challenges, and issues related to consumer acceptance. Nevertheless, with proper dietary composition, optimization of production processes, and further technological advancements, presented alternatives can constitute valuable and sustainable protein sources for the growing global population."}

While lipid-lowering therapies are the cornerstone of ASCVD prevention and treatment, there are other emerging targets, including inflammation (which has been dubbed the \u2018residual inflammatory risk\u2019), that can be addressed after LDL cholesterol thresholds have been reached. Research over the past 20 years has identified C-reactive protein (CRP) as a key marker of inflammation with atherosclerosis. The association of more sensitive measures of CRP (high- sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) with ASCVD risk in epidemiological studies has also led to its incorporation as a risk enhancer in primary prevention guidelines and its incorporation into risk stratification tools. While there are no formal recommendations related to measurement of hsCRP in secondary prevention, consideration should be given to an individualized approach that addresses inflammatory risk in those with major adverse cardiovascular events, despite maximal lipid-lowering therapy and well-controlled LDL cholesterol levels. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of inflammation in ASCVD, the use of hsCRP as a tool to assess residual inflammatory risk to target upstream pathways such as glucose intolerance and obesity, and to consider use of additional anti-inflammatory medications for ASCVD risk reduction. The authors provide clinical context around when to measure hsCRP in clinical practice and how to address residual inflammatory risk in ASCVD."}

Compared with controls, Medalists had worse psychomotor function and recall, which associated with female sex, lower visual acuity, reduced physical activity, longer diabetes duration, and higher inflammatory cytokines. On neuroimaging, compared with controls, Medalists had significantly lower total and regional brain volumes, equivalent to 9 years of accelerated aging, but small vessel disease markers did not differ. Reduced brain volumes associated with female sex, reduced psychomotor function, worse visual acuity, longer diabetes duration, and higher inflammation, but not with glycemic control. Worse cognitive function, lower brain volumes, and diabetic retinopathy correlated with thinning of the outer retinal nuclear layer. Worse baseline visual acuity associated with declining psychomotor function in longitudinal analysis. Brain volume mediated the association between visual acuity and psychomotor function by 57%. Brain pathologies showed decreased volumes, but predominantly mild vascular or Alzheimer\u2019s-related pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of cognitive function, neuroimaging, and pathology in aging T1D individuals demonstrated that cognitive decline was related to parenchymal rather than neurovascular abnormalities, unlike type 2 diabetes, suggestive of accelerated aging in T1D.

This monograph explores the role of flaxseeds in nutrition, as well as their potential risks. Despite their numerous health benefits, flaxseeds also represent concerns due to excessive consumption and possible contamination, particularly from cyanogenic glycosides. Therefore, the levels of these compounds must be controlled, and this monograph also analyzes the available methods to detect and reduce these contaminants, ensuring the safety of flaxseed and flaxseed products consumers. Flaxseed is considered a valuable addition when incorporated into the diet, but it is necessary to continue research and promote technological improvements to maximize their benefits and minimize their risks."}

Such discrepancies could be attributed to disparities in periodontal risk factors, as well as variations in the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Given the substantial Vietnamese population residing in the former German Democratic Republic, the present study aimed to compare the clinical and microbial characteristics of periodontitis patients of Vietnamese Asian origin living in Germany with those of German Caucasian periodontitis patients. A total of 60 patients with a minimum stage II periodontitis diagnosis were included in the study. Of these, 30 were of Vietnamese origin, with an average age of 55 years and a male prevalence of 33.3%. The remaining 30 patients were of German origin, with an average age of 54.5 years and a male prevalence of 40%. The periodontal diagnosis was made in accordance with the recently revised classification of periodontal disease. The pooled subgingival plaque samples were subjected to next-generation sequencing on the MiSeq platform (Illumina). The German patients were significantly more likely to be smokers (56.7% vs 13.3%), had significantly higher body mass index (26 vs 22.6 kg/m\u00b2), probing depth (4.1 vs 3.6 mm), and clinical attachment loss (5 vs 4.1 mm). In terms of microbiota, the Vietnamese patients exhibited significantly lower beta diversity compared to the German patients, and smokers demonstrated a significantly higher beta diversity compared to nonsmokers. The microbiota of both groups differed most significantly in the relative abundance of German patients with periodontitis showed more severe periodontal symptoms and more pronounced periodontal risk factors compared to Vietnamese patients. Both patient groups also showed significant differences in the subgingival microbiota. Compared to Vietnamese living in Germany, German patients have a higher need for periodontal treatment and at the same time the risk factors of smoking and obesity should be reduced. More research is needed before the differences in oral microbiota between the two groups can lead to individualised therapeutic approaches."}

This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of flaxseed supplementation on reproductive endocrine profiles in women with PCOS. In this open-labeled, randomized controlled trial, 70 women with PCOS were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=35), receiving 30 grams of milled flaxseed daily along with lifestyle modifications, or the control group (n=35), receiving only lifestyle modifications, for 12 weeks.

Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of HIV strains resistant to older antiretroviral regimens has necessitated a re-evaluation of treatment strategies. Methods: We performed a retrospective, observational study to evaluate the long-term outcomes of an antiretroviral switch from a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based to bictegravir-based regimen; this study aimed to assess the impact of this antiretroviral switch on treatment adherence, the safety profile, and virologic outcomes. The secondary objectives were to analyze the changes in lipid, kidney function, liver function, and anthropometric parameters after switching. Results: A total of 25 patients were included in this analysis; virologic suppression was maintained over time, with 100% of patients demonstrating undetectable viral loads at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.

The objective of this pilot Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) was to investigate the feasibility of a 25-week adaptive biobehavioral intervention designed to improve insulin sensitivity among patients with stage 1 obesity. Forty participants were initially randomized to either nutrition counseling (NC) or exercise counseling (EC), both employing a weight-neutral approach. At week 8, insulin sensitivity was reassessed using the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI). Participants with a\u2009>\u20095% improvement were classified as responders, while non-responders were re-randomized to either augment their first-stage intervention with metformin or switch to weight loss counseling (WLC). Feasibility outcomes included recruitment and retention, adherence to intervention components, and preliminary treatment effect estimates. Findings support the overall feasibility of the SMART design, with high adherence to virtual counseling sessions and favorable participant retention. The study effectively differentiated responders from non-responders at week 8, with responders showing greater improvements in insulin sensitivity. Among non-responders, WLC and metformin provided a potential rescue effect, but overall insulin sensitivity remained lower than at of responders. While NC and WLC were preferred over EC and metformin, adherence to counseling sessions remained high across all interventions, regardless of preference. Metformin adherence posed challenges due to frequent gastrointestinal side effects and difficulties tracking usage. This pilot study supports the feasibility of an adaptive biobehavioral intervention for improving insulin sensitivity among adults with obesity\u00a0in a primary care setting. However, further refinement is needed to enhance clinical integration, optimize intervention messaging, and improve medication tracking.

A time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model was employed to analyze the time from health examination to the first GC diagnosis, comparing our results with previous cohort studies that evaluated the GC risk through general check-up parameters. Significant risk factors for GC incidence in both genders were age, high levels of AST and \u03b3-GTP, low levels of ALT and hemoglobin. Among males, dyslipidemia, smoking and physical activities were also significantly associated with GC risk. Although further evidence is needed, low hemoglobin levels emerged as a promising potential risk factor for GC, ascertainable through routine general health check-ups."}

Therapeutic competitions were characterized by use of medication for a specific chronic non-communicable disease that negatively affects another disease. We used multinomial logistic regression. Therapeutic competitions were identified for 13.2% of the 1,224 participants. Of this total, 18.7% were considered to be frail individuals. The most prevalent therapeutic competition involved diabetes and cardiovascular disease (4.2% of the total and 6.8% of frail people) with metformin or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The presence of two therapeutic competitions in individuals with multimorbidity increased the likelihood of pre-frailty (odds ratio 2.51; 95% confidence interval 1.10; 5.76). Therapeutic competitions are common in the elderly population and more frequent among frail elderly people, with increased likelihood of pre-frailty when two therapeutic competitions are present."}

This study aimed to measure VCID and HIV-related factors and evaluate their association with cognitive performance. A cross-sectional study. Five cities in the country of Georgia. We enrolled PLWH age \u226540 years. Recruitment and data collection were carried out between February and September 2023. We conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, HIV history, cardiovascular health, mental health, clinical measurements and cognitive performance. We calculated the estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk using the Framingham risk score (FRS). Descriptive analyses were conducted using the frequency distributions of relevant categorical variables and median and IQR for continuous variables. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted separately for each cognitive assessment score. A total of 125 PLWH aged \u226540 years were enrolled in the study. The median FRS was 9% (IQR: 4, 15), with 37 (30%) participants having intermediate risk and 17 (14%) with high risk of cardiovascular event. In univariate correlation analysis, FRS was associated with worse cognitive performance. The FRS remained associated with worse performance on the Trails Making Test B and Grooved Pegboard Test using multivariable models. On average, every 1\u2009per cent increase in FRS corresponded to an increase of 1.65\u2009s (95% CI: 0.11, 3.19, p=0.04) for completing the Trails Making Test B and an increase of 1.02\u2009s (95% CI: 0.43, 1.60, p=0.001) for completing the Grooved Pegboard Test. We found a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk and an association between this risk and cognitive performance in our sample. Our findings provide a baseline that can be further investigated in larger-scale studies with longitudinal assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive performance. Furthermore, it can inform the development of policies and programmes to mitigate adverse effects of VCID on the health of PLWH in Georgia and the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region."}

Our objective was to assess the association between dietary niacin intake and the prevalence of ASCVD. In this cross-sectional study, we examined a cohort of 15,685 adult individuals in the United States, aged 20\u202fyears and older, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) carried out between 2007 and 2014. Dietary Niacin consumption was assessed using a 24-h dietary recall method. The assessment of the presence of ASCVD was conducted through the Patient Medical Conditions Questionnaire. To assess the reliability of the results, restricted cubic spline models and logistic regression analyses were employed, along with conducting subgroup analyses. The analysis included 15,685 participants who were 20\u202fyears or older, drawn from the NHANES data for the cycles spanning 2007 to 2014. Of which 10.4% (1,638/15,685) were diagnosed with ASCVD.

This association held true when niacin consumption was assessed as a categorical variable. Compared to individuals with the lowest dietary niacin intake, defined as T1 (\u226417.4\u202fmg/day), the adjusted odds ratios for ASCVD in those with higher niacin intakes, T2 (17.5\u201327.2\u202fmg/day) and T3 (\u226527.3\u202fmg/day), were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76\u20130.99, This analysis of NHANES data has demonstrated that niacin is significantly negative associated with ASCVD in American adults aged \u226520\u202fyears."}

Obesity is a critical factor adversely affecting reproductive health, ART success rates, and pregnancy outcomes. Recent studies indicate hormonal disruptions, metabolic syndrome, and epigenetic modifications as central mechanisms linking obesity to infertility and adverse pregnancy results. A systematic search adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines included 35 studies, focusing on obesity-related reproductive outcomes. The review highlights that obesity disrupts hormonal balance, including reductions in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone levels, alongside increased insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. These mechanisms impair ovarian function, endometrial receptivity, and sperm quality, resulting in prolonged time-to-pregnancy (TTP), reduced ART success rates, and increased miscarriage risk. During pregnancy, maternal obesity elevates risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery while contributing to neonatal complications, such as macrosomia and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions. The findings emphasize the dual impact of maternal and paternal obesity on offspring health, particularly through epigenetic modifications leading to intergenerational metabolic dysfunction. This review underscores the necessity of preconception weight management, individualized ART protocols, and tailored antenatal care to mitigate obesity\u2019s adverse effects on reproductive outcomes. Future research should focus on understanding male infertility mechanisms, optimizing ART interventions for individuals with obesity, and conducting longitudinal studies on the intergenerational impacts of obesity on reproductive health. This synthesis provides actionable insights to guide clinical practices and future investigations. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13679-025-00629-9."}

Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between T2DM and PC through odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Mendelian randomization (MR) studies were then conducted to explore the causal relationship between T2DM and PC, and causal mediation analysis (CMA) to examine the mediating role of common risk factors. After adjusting for confounding factors, retrospective analysis revealed significant association between new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) and PC risk, with insulin treatment also linked to increased PC development. The standard inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method indicated that genetic susceptibility to T2DM was associated with an increased risk of developing PC (OR\u2009=\u20091.11; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.034\u20131.193). Furthermore, MR showed T2DM, insulin treatment, FGF-4, and sulfhydryl oxidase 2 may be independently associated with the prevalence of PC. Specially, CMA demonstrated that insulin treatment, FGF4, and sulfhydryl oxidase 2 mediate the pathway from T2DM to PC, contributing 56.8%, 55.8%, and 5.9% of the total effect, respectively. This study supports the association between T2DM, specifically NODM, and increased PC risk, with insulin therapy, FGF4, and sulfhydryl oxidase 2 mediating this pathway. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these mediating effects. not applicable.
